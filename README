ASPViz - simple tool for visualising answer set program data

(c) 2008-2009 Owen Cliffe, University of Bath

Command Line Tool: 

aspviz -Cc -n numAnswerSets -v vizprog -f [format] -o [outfile] input files...
	 --format (-f) output format 'svg' or 'png'
	 --output (-o) output file name pattern
	 --size (-s) for raster output, canvas size WxH
	 --combined (-c)  combine answers from problem before visualisation
	 --allcombined (-C)  combine visualisation answer sets for each answer of P before rendering
     --justrender  (-j)  Only render - in this case the input is a solved answer set which includes visualisation primitives (*)
     --paths  (-P)   A colon seperated list of search paths for external artifacts (e.g. images in the rendering) 
     
     
(*) for example:

  clingo  examples/sudoku/su-doku.lp examples/sudoku/puzzle-easy.lp examples/sudoku/visualise.aspviz  lib/aspviz2d.lib 2>&1  | ./aspviz -j 

aspviz accepts one or more unground answer set programs, zero or more viz programs 
and generates zero or more visualisation images based on the answer sets of the 
input programs and viz programs. 

The program invokes a given solver (clingo by default) on the input programs (P) , then 
for each answer set of the underlying program generates a new ground program based 
on the atoms of the input program and solves this with respect to the given viz 
program (V) . 

Viz programs are normal answer set programs which may themselves induce multiple 
answer sets over each answer set of P, output files are labeled according to the answer
set of P which generated them and the visualisation answer set (frame) . 

The list of supported visualisation  atoms is documented in lib/aspviz2d.lp.
